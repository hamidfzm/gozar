Trying to implement a self-hosted solution for passing restrictions made
for Iranian developers.

It's a DNS & forward proxy server. You only set your DNS in your OS. Then the
DNS server will point selected websites to proxy server & bypass others.

Currently, forward proxy server only supports HTTP protocol. I'm looking for
a solution that doesn't require self-generated SSL certificates. Services
like [shecan](https://shecan.ir) or [] are already doing this.

Feel free to make merge requests to improve this project.
